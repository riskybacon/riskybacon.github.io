This tutorial was written for experienced iOS developers with an
Objective
This tutorial describes how to build a Swift iOS app that uses Parse,
without using the supplied starter project. This tutorial was written
for experienced iOS developers with an Objective-C background who
want to use Parse in a Swift app.

## Versions

This tutorial was written for:

 * Xcode 6.3
 * Parse SDK 1.7.1
 * iOS 8.3

## Create Parse App

Go to [parse.com](https://parse.com) and create an app. Get an account if
you don't already have one. Make a note of your keys, you'll need them later

## Download SDK

Download the [Parse iOS SDK](https://www.parse.com/downloads/ios/parse-library/latest). Create a new project iOS Swift project, copy in the frameworks from the SDK download.

## Create Xcode Project

Open up Xcode, create new project. Make it an iOS Single View Application.
Set the language pop up menu to Swift.

## Add Frameworks

Copy in the following frameworks:

* Parse.framework
* Bolts.framework

Make sure to check the "Copy items if needed" checkbox. If you want Parse
support in your test target, check that box, too.

Add these Linked Frameworks and Libraries to your target:

* Accounts.framework
* Social.framework
* MobileCoreServices.framework
* Security.framework
* SystemConfiguration.framework
* AudioToolbox.framework
* libz.dylib
* libsqlite3.dylib
* libstdc++.dylib

## Create a Bridging Header

File -> New -> iOS -> Source -> Header File

Name it *YourProject-Bridging-Header.h*

Open up that file, replace the existing content with:

```swift
#import <Parse/Parse.h>
#import <Bolts/BFTask.h>
```

* Select your project, target, build settings
* Add YourProject/YourProject-Bridging-Header.h to the Objective-C bridging header 
* If you have compile errors, you may need to restart Xcode

## AppDelegate

In AppDelegate.swift, make your *application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:* function look like:

```swift
func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
    let parseAppId     = "your_parse_app_id"
    let parseClientKey = "your_parse_client_key"
        
    Parse.setApplicationId(parseAppId, clientKey: parseClientKey)
        
    var testObject = PFObject(className: "TestObject")
    testObject["foo"] = "bar"
    testObject.saveEventually()

    return true
}
```

## Run It

Run the code, head over to Parse and check to see if a table called TestObject exists with your test object.
